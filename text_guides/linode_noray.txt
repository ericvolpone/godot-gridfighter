Noray Setup in Linode

https://cloud.linode.com/linodes  Create Linode 
- Region close to where your traffic will be
- I chose Shared Nano (cheapest option)
- Give your linode a Label (name)
- Give it a password for SSH
- Create a firewall
	- SSH on 22: Accept IPv4 and IPv6
	- Registration on 8890, 8891: Accept IPv4 and IPv6
	- Registrar on 8809, 49152-51200: Accept IPv4 and IPv6

Once Linode is running, get dependencies…

- SSH into Linode IP with password created in step 1
- `mkdir Nora`
- `git clone https://github.com/foxssake/noray.git`
- Install Node Version Manager:
	- `curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash`
- Activate NVM: `source ~/.bashrc`
	- Install Node: `nvm install --lts`
- Install PNPM: `npm install -g pnpm@latest-10`

Now that you have depencies, configure Noray.
Noray’s installation docs likely take over from here.. but just in case

- Copy and paste this file into your noray directly as .env
	- https://github.com/foxssake/noray/blob/main/.env.example
- `pnpm install` to get all noray dependencies
- `pnpm start` to run the server

Now in your Godot game’s code, just change your “tomfol.io” to your Linode’s public IP address

For future proofing, go into Images in Linode and capture the image of your noray Linode.
This way, if you lose or delete your linode, you can restore it via the image
Or you could use scaling with that image to scale up and down based on traffic with some
load balancer / domain if you have one.
