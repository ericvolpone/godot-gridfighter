Clean up movement for AI and Player.  There needs to be some handling of input better for player controlled characters

Tutorial levels need to know when to move forward.  Build a few more!
	You got win conditions working generally, but we should probably free up AI and have players respawn if they fall off

Tutorial ideas:
	Punching a rock thats being thrown at you
	Punching a person off the map
	Maybe using block to dodge an incoming rock?
