We have tutorials and a basic KOTH map with rotating rings.

Now we would like to do a few things

KOTH: 
	Scoring works!
	This could be a good use of the HUD, adding a side scoreboard and giving players names
		Potentially a win condition
	Build some AIs that just run towards the current ring location?

Player
	Add the punch!  It should just knock back people in front of you with minimal cooldown
		We may be able to learn about raycasts here if we want, or just look at a cone in front

Levels
	For some reason, _process isnt running so scoring is done in _physics_process... figure this out
